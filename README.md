# PAW - Pazardjik Animal Welfare
This project is part of my full stack development course at Code Institute. Its primarily aim is to aim me in completing the first Milestone Project in the course. However, when successfully developed, it will be gifted to PAW as their first website. 

With it I hope they manage to attract more donations and get in contact with more foster parents for their sheltered animals. 
## Demo

Here is a link to the live version on the site on GitHub Pages - https://naity17.github.io/PAW-website-project/

## UX
The UX is designed to attract two main target groups:

1. Animal enthusiasts who are not able to adopt, but have a financial stability to support the causes of the PAW organization.
2. People, willing to adopt one of the rescued and sheltered dogs. 

# Technologies Used 

## Programming Languages 
1. HTML - used for the structure and layout of the website
2. CSS - used to compliment Bootstrap and give more cusomized look to the website

## Frameworks
1. Bootstrap - CSS Framework, which saves time by provideing predefined styling.
2. Font Awesome - library with icons, which could be integrated in the HTML
3. Google Fonts - Googles' fonts library, from where the fonts on the website are taken.

## Features
Features to implement in the future
With my fututre progress in the course, I would like to add a payment links, which would ease the efforts of the visitors and encourage them to donate with only a couple of clicks.

New dogs and their stories will be also constantly updated.

## Testing

Below is a list of websites I used for testing:
1. https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - The W3C CSS Validation Service, used to validate my CSS
2. https://validator.w3.org/ - The W3C Markup Validation Service, used to validate my HTML


- The website is easily navigated and there is a Donate button on nearly every page. Additionaly, there is a whole page dedicated to the varios methods one can contribute financially and various contact details in case they would like to receive additional information.
- For the people wishing to adopt an animal, currently there is a brief presentation of the animals which need a home. It is planned as a future improvement to add more content and external links to showcase more of the animals in need. 

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 6 S, Xaiomi, Samsung) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

The website was presentd to a couple of full-stack developer professionals for peer review and their remarks have been changed in the code. 

### Behavious of buttons and links

The logo on the left side of the Navigation panel is a link to the landing page, which allows visitors to return to it from any page they are currently viewing.
Currently, the Donate button does not lead to a payment link page, but this is the primary goal with the dvelopment of this website.
On every page there is a button, leading to the next one. E.g. at the edn of the landing page there is "Our Causes" button which leads to the spective page. This is done to encourage the visitors to continue browsing information and eventually take an action - donate, adopt or forster.

The Facebook link in the foter leads directly to the social media page of the organization. The contact form has required fields such as "Name", "Email" and "Message". In the future this form will be linked to annnet@abv.bg mailbox. 

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages and is deplayed directly from the master branch. If there are new commits, the site will update automatically. To ensure the correct deployment of https://naity17.github.io/PAW-website-project/, the landing page is named index.html.

If you would like to run this repository locally, you can do so by typing <git clone> and pasting the following link: https://github.com/Naity17/PAW-website-project in your terminal. To remove it simply type <git remote rm origin> into the terminal.

## Content

All content comes from the Facebook page of PAW - Pazardjik Animal Welfare. The English translation of the content was done by me.

## Media

The media content was also provided by the volunteers at PAW and downloaded from their Facebook page.

## Acknowledgements

All ideas have been taken from the Code Institute's tutorial videos and sample projects, Stack Overflow and W3Schools.

Additionally, the mentorship of Anthony Ngene was vital for the realization of this project.

This project is currently for educational use.
